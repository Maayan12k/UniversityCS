   - Low-level programming using assembly language, focusing on direct interaction with hardware components.
   - Demonstrates understanding of CPU architecture, memory management, and instruction sets.
   
2. **Computer Architecture**
   - Explores how computers are structured and operate at the hardware level.
   - Includes topics such as logic gates, processor design, memory hierarchy, and performance optimization.

3. **Data Structures and Algorithms**
   - Contains implementations of fundamental data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming).
   - Emphasizes algorithm design, complexity analysis, and real-world application.

4. **Numerical Methods**

## The Learning Journey: From Hardware to Algorithms

This repository follows a progression from understanding **low-level hardware interactions** in Assembly Language and Computer Architecture to mastering **high-level algorithmic thinking** in Data Structures and Algorithms. By working through these areas, I have built a robust foundation in both computer system fundamentals and the design of efficient software solutions.

- **Assembly Language** gives insight into how software interacts directly with hardware, allowing for efficient resource management.
- **Computer Architecture** bridges the gap between software and hardware, providing a deeper understanding of how code executes on real machines.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms** take the lessons from lower levels and apply them to build scalable and optimized solutions for complex computational problems.
- **Numerical Methods** showcases the application of computational techniques to solve scientific and engineering problems.
- **GPU Computing** introduces the power of parallel processing to handle data-intensive computations, enhancing performance significantly.
