# Hardware Simulation Project

This folder contains `.hdl` files where I built and simulated various hardware devices as part of a computer architecture project. These devices include:

- Basic Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.)
- Multiplexers (MUX)
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Other hardware components used in digital systems

Each `.hdl` file corresponds to a specific hardware component, designed and tested using a hardware description language (HDL). These components were simulated to verify their functionality and correctness.
