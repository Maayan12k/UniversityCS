# Simple Computer Assembly Project

This folder contains `.hdl` files that represent the final steps in assembling a simple computer using hardware description language (HDL).

## Overview
Each `.hdl` file corresponds to a top-level component that is essential for the computer's functionality, including:

- **CPU**: The central processing unit that executes instructions.
- **Computer**: The integration of the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
- **Memory**: The high level memory devices such as RAM.
- **Helper Logic Devices**: Additional components such as registers, multiplexers, and control units that support the operation of the CPU and computer.

These components work together to form a fully functional, simulated computer system. The project represents the culmination of building and integrating basic hardware components into a complete computer architecture.
