# Jack Programming Language Project

This project contains files written in the **Jack programming language**, which is similar to Java. The goal of this project is to run and experiment with these files to become familiar with the syntax and features of Jack.

Jack is a simple, high-level language designed for educational purposes, often used in teaching computer systems and compilers.

The files in this folder are part of the learning process to understand how Jack programs are structured and executed.
