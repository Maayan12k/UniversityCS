# Fill.asm Program

My work in this folder is the `fill.asm` file, written in Hack Assembly Language. 

## Functionality:
The program waits for keyboard input in an infinite loop. Once a key is pressed, it triggers specific behavior (e.g., filling the screen or performing an action). The logic continuously monitors for input, ensuring the program responds appropriately when a key is detected.

This project showcases the implementation of low-level input handling using Hack Assembly.
