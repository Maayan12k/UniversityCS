# Jack to VM Translator Compiler

This project is a simple compiler that translates Jack code into VM Translator code. 

## Main Components:

- **CompilationEngine.java**: The core engine of the compiler, responsible for converting Jack code into VM Translator code.
- **JackAnalyzer.java**: A helper class that analyzes Jack code, breaking it down into meaningful components.
- **JackTokenizer.java**: A helper class that tokenizes Jack code, preparing it for further analysis and compilation.

The purpose of this compiler is to bridge the gap between Jack, a high-level programming language, and VM Translator code, which can be used to generate machine code.
