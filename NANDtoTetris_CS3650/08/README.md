# VMTranslator Project Part 2

This folder contains the **VMTranslator**, a program that translates virtual machine (VM) code into assembly code. The assembly code generated by this translator is then ready to be converted into binary code that the CPU can execute.

## Main Components:

- **VMTranslator.java**: The main engine of the project. This class orchestrates the translation process, converting VM commands into assembly instructions.
- **CodeWriter.java**: A helper class that generates assembly code for each VM command. It handles the low-level details of writing correct assembly instructions.
- **Parser.java**: Another helper class that reads and parses the VM commands, breaking them down for translation into assembly.

Together, these components translate high-level VM code into low-level assembly, forming a crucial step in the pipeline from VM code to binary code.
