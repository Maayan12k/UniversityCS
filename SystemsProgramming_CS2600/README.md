# Systems Programming Projects

This directory contains the work I completed for my Systems Programming class. Throughout the course, I developed a variety of programs and tackled several challenges using the C programming language. These projects demonstrate my understanding of systems-level concepts, including client-server communication, multithreading, and network programming.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Client-Server Socket Program
In this project, I implemented a simple client-server model using sockets in C. The server listens for incoming connections and communicates with multiple clients, handling requests and responses through network sockets.

### 2. Multithreading Array Assignment
This project involved solving array manipulation problems using multithreading. By dividing tasks among threads, I was able to enhance performance and utilize concurrency to efficiently process large datasets.

### 3. Wi-Fi Connection Selector Program
The Wi-Fi connection selector was designed to scan available networks and choose the optimal one based on signal strength and other criteria. This program demonstrates my skills in handling low-level networking tasks and interacting with system resources.

### 4. Other C Programming Challenges
In addition to the major projects, the class covered various other challenges and smaller assignments that focused on key concepts such as memory management, file I/O, and process control in C. These helped solidify my knowledge of systems programming.

## Skills Gained
- Client-Server Communication
- Multithreading and Concurrency
- Network Programming
- Memory Management in C
- Process Control and File I/O

These projects represent my hands-on experience with systems programming and my proficiency in using the C programming language to solve complex, low-level problems.
